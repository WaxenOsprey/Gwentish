## Introduction
This is a brief for a browser game based for a card game. The card game is insipired by Gwent from the Witcher Series.

This brief provides further information on the MVP and extensions for this specific app.

## Project Aim
Create a browser-based Gwent card game app that replicates the key features and gameplay mechanics of the original game.

## MVP
- Turn-based gameplay with rules based on Gwent, including:
  - Implement rarity levels for cards, affecting their power or special abilities
  - Drawing cards at the beginning of the game
  - Playing cards with abilities and power values
  - Taking turns and playing cards strategically
  - Determining the winner based on card power
- A visual display of player's lives and scores
- Integration with the backend to handle game logic and rules
- A feature for players to register and log in to the game
- A deck-building feature where players can create and customize their card decks

## EXTENSIONS
- Implement different factions with unique abilities and card sets
- Include an AI opponent for single-player mode
- Implement a leaderboard to track player rankings and scores

## Uses of APIs
The app will utilize the Spring Boot framework to handle the back-end and game logic. GwentOne API will also be used to make calls to display card images.

## Uses of databases
The app will make use of a database to store player information, including registration details, login credentials, and game progress.


## Intended tech stack

- **Front end**: React, CSS
- **Back End**: Java Spring Boot
- **Databse**: PostgreSQL
