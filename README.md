# Gwentish! - A Browser Card Game App

**Gwentish** is a browser-based card game app based on the popular card game Gwent from the Witcher series. The app will allow players to register and log in to play the game, and will feature a deck-building feature where players can customize their card decks. The game will be turn-based, with rules based on Gwent, including drawing cards at the beginning of the game, playing cards with abilities and power values, taking turns and playing cards strategically, and determining the winner based on card power. The app will also feature a visual display of player's lives and scores, and will integrate with the backend to handle game logic and rules.

## Built with:

- PostgreSQL
- Spring
- Java
